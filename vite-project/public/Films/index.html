            Now I know that you are not supposed to put baby in a corner, but is a microwave ok? (Mind you, I've been on
            enough flights lately to find that latter idea has definite merit!). Anyway, this takes a while to get going
            as we are introduced to "Barry" (Ezra Miller) and taken through the family scenario that led his mother to
            be slaughtered in a burglary and to his father being charged with the murder. Desperate to save his dad from
            the chair and and to reincarnate mom, he decides to use his great speed to take on time itself! Despite
            being warned against this potentially reckless action by "Batman" (the most fleeting of appearances from Ben
            Affleck) he goes for it; gets knocked out of the timeline and finds himself face to face with - himself
            (only much better looking with wavy hair). This isn't the only thing that's changing on the old space-time
            continuum and shortly after, "General Zod" (Michael Shannon) arrives bent on avenging the destruction of his
            home world of "Krypton" on the people of Earth. "Barry" has to think on his nimble feet, and try to assemble
            what he can of the "Justice League" to combat this threat. Turns out "Bruce Wayne" (now Michael Keaton) has
            rather let himself go and "Superman" is being held in an impenetrable metal scrotum in Siberia. Time to
            galvanise and get a-rescuing before his future, all of their futures, are lost. Can they all save the world?
            I liked this film. It's got loads of action, plenty of pith in a script that is at the more adult (without
            loads of expletives) end of the spectrum and Miller has the "P" word. Personality. They are clearly enjoying
            this, and there is loads of charisma emanating from both performances from a star who bucks the normal trend
            of being handsome but rather wooden. Miller is the former, certainly, but they bring life to the role. It's
            fun, and abetted by a story that has some weight and plenty of pace to it, we are taken on a series of
            lightly comedic adventures that make 2 hours and 20 minutes quite literally whizz by. Sasha Calle gives us
            some diversion from the Ezra show as Superman's cousin - no slouch in a fight either, and Keaton does fine
            as he rehabilitates his disillusioned "Batman" character using his gadgets and gizmos to great effect. It's
            so much better than I was expecting and I have to say that I enjoyed the quirkiness of Miller's
            interpretation of "Barry" - nowhere near as sterile and simpering as Grant Gustin's pure as the driven snow
            portrayal. The multiverse can keep on inventing and reinventing scenarios and the visual effects can work
            wonders making just about anything possible - but without strong and personable characters then I am sure I
            will just bore of the relentless repetition of these stories. Miller is different. Sure, we all know of
            their much publicised flaws, but I hope the studio look past that and commit to a sequel that allows this
            actor to continue to do what they do well here - and that's to entertain us. Needs a big screen, it will
            look very ordinary on the telly.

        <p>_The Flash_. First announced in 2014 and released in mid-2023, it is arguably one of the worst DC movies to
            this date. Throughout all the problems, the most incomprehensible is certainly how Warner kept allowing such
            a person as Ezra Miller to be cast as the main role to be the face of a hero. With a budget of $200 million
            they were able to deliver the worst possible CGI ever seen, and with it a crumbled plot that wishes for more
            of everything but Flash. Michael Keaton has done a brilliant performance within this movie as a throwback to
            the 89's Batman. And with it, the new addition to the Justice League, Sasha Calle has done a fantastic job
            as Supergirl (Kara Zor-El), but both get rushed plot points that makes the audience wish for more of their
            screen time or even a solo movie and not the teenage nuisance that Barry Allen is. One minute, Supergirl
            rushes out ignoring everything, the other she's at the door regretting her decision and trying to help the
            rest of the characters. The same can be said about Michael Keaton's character. The movie dives into the
            concept of time and its dangerous potential, later forgetting everything about it and labeling it
            "multiverse" instead, following Marvel's recent movies like _Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness_
            and _Spider-Man: No Way Home_ and not adding a single spark of creativity with it. But those movies at least
            have decent scores, the music within this one must have been selected from a random kid's playlist... The
            movie is also 2h 24m long, being completely unnecessary. Various scenes are completly descartable, an action
            scene at the start was put there with no thought whatsoever and is 15m of wasted narrative that could be
            used to invest in Supergirl's story (if she is here to stay). Iris West has no reason to be put into the
            movie. And for some reason they decided to make a bunch of cameos using CGI, and as previously said, that
            didn't go well. In the end, DC is still the same mess. They can't properly build a plot and create a movie
            that sustains its own beliefs. Ben Affleck's Batman, at the start, said we can't change our past due to the
            fact that those key moments that leave scars are the moments that build our foundation and make us who we
            are. It seems that Barry Allen didn't learn shit from this two-hour journey.</p>
